            <h2 id="title-1">Pools lend tokens to the hotels for ModiHost operations and receive rewards in return</h2>
            <p>The pool operator can configure the fee (reward) amount. Since pool operators are not necessarily token holders themselves, and pools can provide tokens from multiple token holders, the fee is split between the pool operator and tokenholders. Again this split is configurable by the pool operator.</p>
            <p>A Pool is a smart contract in the Ethereum network which can be generated and deployed to the Ethereum network using the «Create a pool» interface at ModiHost Pool Explorer.</p>
            <p>There is an option to create a public or private pool:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Public pools allow anyone to put tokens into it.</li>
                <li>Private pools work only with the Pool Owner’s tokens.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Pool tokens lent to hotel operations are in constant circulation, earning interest for the token holders. Every holder may join a pool to lend tokens to hotels.</p>
            <h2 id="title-2">How to Create a Pool</h2>
            <p>Anyone with enough amount of AIM tokens required for Collateral Amount can create ModiHost public or private Pool.</p>
            <blockquote>
                <h5>Requirements</h5>
                <p>Metamask extension installed and logged in with your Ethereum address you would like to use to create a Pool. Holding enough AIM tokens to cover Collateral amount.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>
                <h5>Important</h5>
                <p>Create Pool only from the Ethereum address fully controlled by you. Keep your Pool Owner Ethereum private key safe. Lose control of your Pool Owner Ethereum address leads to lose of your Pool control.</p>

            </ol>
            <p>A Pool is created with certain rules and several customizable parameters. The owner of the Pool can change such parameters during Pool operations:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>% rewards that the Pool requires for using its tokens</li>
                <li>% rewards, which the Pool guarantees token holders</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Pool settings are defined when the Pool is created:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Collateral amount, which affects the speed of iteration of tokens and their availability for the next operation;</li>
                <li>Choose if the Pool is private or public.</li>
                <li>Lending Restriction. If this setting is checked, then pool will only lend tokens to Hotels in the list. This allows pool owner to limit the hotels it works with.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The combination of these parameters will affect the priority of the Pool. This ensures the market regulation of the cost of lending tokens.</p>
